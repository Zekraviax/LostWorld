How do Techniques differ from Spells?
Any number of the following ways:
* Scales off the user's Strength instead of Intelligence by default. But can scale of Agility as well.
* Techniques require practice to master. Using an unmastered technique means reduced effectiveness, but repetition is required for mastery.
* Some characters have a different resource from MP to play cards. Characters that don't have MP can't play Spells but can use Techniques.
* Techniques are inspired by real world things such as martial arts.


What is a Shout?
* A Shout is a special type of card. 
* Shouts don't cost anything to play by default, but can only be played once per turn.
* Shouts can have additional or secondary costs.


What is a Chant?
* A Chant is a special type of card. 
* When one entity plays a Chant, they begin "chanting". 
* If the chanter plays any other card, the current chant ends. If they play a different Chant, then the current one ends and the second chant begins.
* The Chanters allies can join in. On their turn they will have a "cardless" card that lets them participate in the Chant. "Cardless" cards cannot leave the zone they're
* The more people that participate in a Chant, the more effective it is.
* Chants need to be played by at least one caracter per turn cycle in order to be maintained. If a whole turn cycle goes by with nobody contributing, it will end. That means the Chant can go on if the entity who started it is defeated or stops chanting.


List of Keywords and their effects:
* Repeater: When you play this card, it goes to the top of your draw pile instead of your discard pile. If a card with Repeater is exiled upon play, then the exile effect takes priority.
* Ace: You are guaranteed to draw this card during your first turn of battle.
* Temporary: This card disappears (is exiled) at the end of your turn if its in any zone other than your exile.
* Exile: When you play this card, exile it instead of sending it to your discard pile. In any other situation, it is discarded normally.

Right-clicking on a card will open the ACD. This is a whole screen detailed display of the card.

The ACD can also provide clarification card effects that may be confusing or ambiguous, in addition to information on how the card interacts with other things.

They are one part sentient being, one part force of nature, and one part ?
They created all worlds, and each of the eight played a different part.


Demigods

They do not age, like the gods. But they can be killed, like mortals.
Despite to their semi-eternal lives, all demigods do eventually die.
Their mortal minds cannot resist the temptations of their godly power forever. They succumb to a very mortal kind of corruption and make mistakes that get them killed.

Belome, the Bandit
Random Event
You are stopped by a rugged, battle-scarred man. He demands you pay a price before he will let you pass. You can:
- Agree to pay, in which case he will remember this and demand more payment if you cross paths again.
- Refuse and turn away. He won't do much if you decide to take a different path.
- Fight him. He prefers to fight dirty, but will try to stop the fight if you bring him low, in which case:
-- You can continue to fight. His behaviour will grow more desperate. If you kill him, you will never see him again.
-- You can let him go. If you encounter him again, he will remember that you spared him, and act more favourably to you.
- If you have enough of a reputation, his "tough-guy" demeanor will be shaken, and he will change his mind, allowing you to pass for free. You may pass, or take any of the previous options. You can also talk to him. With enough conversations, you can convince him to join you.

Level Scaling:
Core Mechanic
As players clear floors, enemies will get stronger and more deadly, but higher risk also means higher rewards. Level Scaling is optional, and is off by default.
Bosses are by default exempt from all scaling modifiers, unless the player decides to disable this exemption.
Scaling modifiers are cumulative, and don't disappear until the player leaves the level by any means.
Floors will always give a negative modifier. Every 2nd(?) floor will give a positive modifier in addition to the negative modifier.
Some of the more difficult modifiers will never appear on lower level floors. Each of these modifiers will have a MinimumFloor value that the player must reach before they will appear.
Some scaling modifiers have a cap. Once this cap is reached, these modifiers will not be applied any more.

List of Level Scaling modifiers:
- Enemy cards have +1 Total Damage.
- Enemies get +1 to their highest stat.
- Enemies get +1 to either their Strength or Intelligence, whichever is higher.
- Enemies have +1 Agility.
- Enemies have +1 Total HP and MP.
- Enemies that can Call For Friends are more likely to do so.
- Encounters start with another enemy. Some enemies are Unique; there can only be one in a battle, including all (most?) bosses. But bosses can have minions - the same type of enemies that can be found in the level.
- Cards are more likely to be a higher rarity.
- Find +1 card from encounters/treasure chests that give cards.
- Reward Encounters give more rewards. Or in other words, "Some random encounters are more rewarding."


Reward Encounters
Terminology
Shorthand phrase that describes random encounters that give the player stuff; cards, money, equipment, XP, other items. 


Succumb To Darkness
Light Spell

This entity's cards have +1 Total Power per stack but they take damage equal to 1/5 of the damage their cards deal.
